# VBA-challenge

I created this repository for VBA-Challenge (Assignment - Module 2 Challenge)


In this challenge, I created a VBA script that loops through all the stocks in the given excel file for each quarter and outputs the following information:

a) The ticker symbol
b) Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
c) The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
d) The total stock volume of the stock. The result matches the given image.

Related to the repo, I have created 3 folders:

1. Excel File - This contains the excel file which was used and formatted (as per instructions).
2. Screenshots - This contains the Screenshots of the results
3. VBA Script - This folder contains the vba script developed (and ran successfully on the excel file).

Kindly feel free to reach out to me in case you see any issues.

Although this is a public repo but in case you are not able to access any of the files, kindly feel free to leave me a message.
